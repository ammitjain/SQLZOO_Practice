SUM and COUNT
==================

1.SELECT SUM(population) FROM world

2. select distinct continent from world

3. select sum(gdp) from world where continent = 'Africa'

4. select count(name) from world where area >= 1000000

5. select sum(population) from world where name in ('Estonia','Latvia','Lithuania')

6. select continent,count(name) from world group by continent

7. select continent,count(name) from world where population >=10000000 group by continent

8.select continent from world group by continent having sum(population) >= 100000000


The JOIN Operation
=========================
1. SELECT g1.matchid,g1.player FROM goal g1 join game g2 on g2.id=g1.matchid WHERE teamid = 'GER'

2. SELECT distinct id,stadium,team1,team2   FROM game g1 join goal g2 on g1.id = g2.matchid  where g2.matchid = '1012'

3. SELECT g2.player,g2.teamid,g1.stadium,g1.mdate FROM game g1 JOIN goal g2 ON (g1.id=g2.matchid) where g2.teamid='GER'

4. SELECT g1.team1,g1.team2,g2.player FROM game g1 JOIN goal g2 ON (g1.id=g2.matchid) where g2.player like 'Mario%'

5. SELECT player, teamid, coach, gtime FROM goal g join eteam e on (teamid=id) WHERE gtime<=10	

6. select g1.mdate,e.teamname from game g1 join eteam e on g1.team1=e.id where e.coach='Fernando Santos'

7. select g2.player from game g1 join goal g2 on g1.id=g2.matchid where g1.stadium= 'National Stadium, Warsaw' and g2.gtime is not null

8. SELECT distinct player FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id WHERE (team1='GER' or team2='GER') and goal.teamid <> 'GER'

9. SELECT teamname, count(gtime)  FROM eteam JOIN goal ON id=teami group by teamname  ORDER BY teamname

10. SELECT g2.stadium,count(gtime) FROM goal g1 JOIN game g2 ON id=matchid group by stadium ORDER BY stadium

11. SELECT matchid,mdate,count(gtime)   FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id  WHERE (team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL') group by matchid,mdate

12. SELECT matchid,mdate,count(gtime) FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id WHERE (team1 = 'GER' OR team2 = 'GER') and teamid = 'GER' group by matchid,mdate

13. SELECT mdate,
  team1,
  sum(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score1,
team2,
  sum(CASE WHEN teamid=team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score2
  FROM game left JOIN goal ON matchid = id
group by mdate,team1,team2
order by mdate, matchid,team1,team2
